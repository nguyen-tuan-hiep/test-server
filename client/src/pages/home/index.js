                What is RMS? A restaurant management system is a type of
                point-of-sale (POS) software specifically designed for
                restaurants, bars, food trucks and others in the food service
                industry. Unlike a POS system, RMS encompasses all back-end
                needs, such as inventory and staff management. This RMS prepares
                your website for use on all devices. Responsive websites
                dynamically resizes content and images for all different screen
                sizes for use on any device. With more than 50% of internet
                traffic coming from devices other than laptops and desktops, a
                site which isnâ€™t responsive potentially loses half of its
                customers.
